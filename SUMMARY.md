# E5 — MTLResidencySet over the existing malloc'd slabs (experiment branch)

Branch: `e5/metal-residency-set` (cut from `origin/dev` @ `caa49f7`, per spec — E4 was cut
from `main` @ `72d3d37`; `backend_metal.mm`/`.h` are byte-identical between the two bases,
confirmed via `git diff 72d3d37 origin/dev -- c/backend_metal.mm c/backend_metal.h`).

## The hypothesis

E4 (MTLHeap-backed slabs) proved that batching residency declaration kills the GPU stall
(25.9s → 3.9s at cap16, −85%), but changing the *allocation* (heap sub-buffers instead of
malloc'd host memory) brought a +12–13s expert-disk-load tax, suspected first-touch/lock
contention on CPU-writes into GPU-owned heap pages. E5 decouples the two: keep the exact
same malloc'd slabs and per-slab `newBufferWithBytesNoCopy`-wrapped `MTLBuffer`s, and change
**only** residency bookkeeping — declare residency once, ahead of time, on a set attached to
the command queue, instead of once per command buffer via `useResource:`. If the stall
reduction survives without the load-path tax (malloc pages never change ownership), E5 wins.

## What changed

Everything is confined to `c/backend_metal.mm`. **No changes to `glm.c` or
`backend_metal.h`** — `coli_metal_register`/`coli_metal_unregister`'s existing signatures and
every call site in `glm.c` (expert_load, uring_load_add, qalloc, kv_alloc, map_of_fd) are
untouched; the residency-set bookkeeping lives entirely inside those two functions' existing
bodies. This is a smaller diff shape than E4, which needed new `backend_metal.h` declarations
and new `glm.c` call sites because it changed the allocation function itself.

Env-gated `COLI_METAL_RESSET=1`, default OFF, runtime `@available(macOS 15.0, *)` guard with
a one-line stderr fallback when requested on an older OS or when residency-set creation
fails. Gate off ⇒ every new branch is skipped and behavior is byte-for-byte the stock path
(verified by inspection: `g_resset_enabled` starts `false` and nothing sets it except inside
the `COLI_METAL_RESSET` `getenv` branch in `coli_metal_init`, so `resset_add`/`resset_remove`/
`resset_flush` are no-ops and `moe_submit`'s `useResource:` loop runs unconditionally).

### Lifecycle (`c/backend_metal.mm`)

- **Init** (`coli_metal_init`, end of the existing pipeline-setup `@autoreleasepool`): if
  `COLI_METAL_RESSET=1` and `@available(macOS 15.0, *)`, create one
  `MTLResidencySetDescriptor` (`initialCapacity=4096`, a presize hint only), call
  `[g_dev newResidencySetWithDescriptor:desc error:&err]`, and `[g_queue addResidencySet:rs]`
  — one set, attached once, for the process lifetime. Failure (old OS or creation error)
  prints one stderr line and leaves `g_resset_enabled=false` — stock path.
- **`coli_metal_register`**: after wrapping the buffer exactly as today
  (`newBufferWithBytesNoCopy`), calls `resset_add(b)` under the *same* `g_slab_mtx` that
  already serializes `g_slabs` mutation from parallel OMP loader threads. `resset_add` calls
  `[rs addAllocation:b]` and sets a `g_resset_dirty` flag — **it does not commit**.
- **`coli_metal_unregister`**: calls `resset_remove(b)` (also under `g_slab_mtx`) *before*
  clearing the `g_slabs` entry. `resset_remove` calls `[rs removeAllocation:b]` **and commits
  immediately** — no batching. See UNCERTAINTIES for why this asymmetry is deliberate.
- **`moe_submit`** (the one function whose `use` list — resolved expert weight/scale slabs —
  scales with LRU cache size): calls `resset_flush()` at the top (commits any pending adds
  from `resset_add`, under `g_slab_mtx`), then, if `g_resset_enabled`, **skips** the
  `for(auto&b:use) [e useResource:b usage:MTLResourceUsageRead];` loop entirely — residency
  is already guaranteed by the queue-attached set. Every other `useResource:` call site in the
  file (`bind_gemv`'s weight/scale buffers, `coli_metal_attn_decode`/`coli_metal_layer_decode`'s
  `Lb`/`Rb`/`kvbW`/`kvbS`/`inB`/`pnB`/`rwB`/`rbB`, `coli_metal_gemm`'s `wb`/`sb`) is
  **left completely unchanged**, regardless of the flag — see "Why only `moe_submit`" below.
- **Shutdown** (`coli_metal_shutdown`): `[g_queue removeResidencySet:rs]` then clears the
  globals, ahead of the existing `g_queue=nil; g_dev=nil;`.

### Why only `moe_submit` skips `useResource:`

Apple's own `MTLResidencySet` docs are explicit: *"Residency sets don't support hazard
tracking, so you need to account for hazards with fences and events."* (confirmed against
the actual SDK header comment and Apple's "Simplifying GPU resource management with residency
sets" guide, both read directly for this design — see UNCERTAINTIES for the exact quotes and
how they were obtained). Dropping `useResource:` therefore risks losing whatever
hazard-tracking value those calls provided. Rather than apply the residency set uniformly and
argue *in general* that hazard tracking isn't load-bearing, this diff draws the line at the
one call site the mechanism history actually implicates:

`moe_submit`'s `use` vector holds only **read-only** (`MTLResourceUsageRead`), **indirectly
referenced** slab buffers — the kernel (`moe_gemv`) never touches them via `setBuffer:`; it
dereferences raw GPU addresses (`waddr[e]`/`saddr[e]`) baked into a separately-bound address
array (`bag`/`bau`/`bad`/`bsg`/`bsu`/`bsd`), which is exactly the "indirect reference" case
`useResource:` exists for. No GPU-side write ever touches these buffers, so there is no
write-after-write/read-after-write hazard for Metal's tracking to have been serializing in
the first place; the one real hazard — a slab unregistered+freed+reused by the CPU while an
async in-flight `moe_block_begin` command buffer still references it via a baked-in GPU
address — is a **CPU-write race that Metal's hazard tracking never protected against anyway**
(hazard tracking only covers GPU-side command dependencies visible through the Metal API; a
raw host-memory write via `pread`/`memcpy` is invisible to it regardless of `useResource:`).
That race is, and always was, the engine's own responsibility (slot/generation lifecycle: a
slab isn't freed while an outstanding async handle still owns it) — unrelated to E5.

Every other call site (`bind_gemv`, attention K/V cache writes) either doesn't scale with
cache size (fixed per-layer dense tensors — no perf benefit to touching) or has real
GPU-side write traffic in the same encoder (`Lb`/`Rb` are written by `a_copy` and read by
`a_score`/`a_clat` within one encoder — currently ordered by explicit
`memoryBarrierWithScope:MTLBarrierScopeBuffers` calls already present in `encode_attention`,
not by `useResource:`'s hazard tracking, but touching them wasn't needed for the hypothesis
and was judged not worth the added surface area). Leaving them untouched keeps the diff's
blast radius matched to the one seam the fix-plan's v5 finding actually names.

### Deferred-commit design (`resset_add` batches; `resset_remove` doesn't)

`coli_metal_register` is called from parallel OpenMP loader threads in tight bursts
("warmup fan-out" — same phrase E4's audit used for the same threads). Committing on every
single `addAllocation:` would reintroduce a per-slab cost on the load path, which is exactly
what E4's own +12s regression looked like (mutex held across a live Metal call, serializing
loader threads). So `resset_add` only marks `g_resset_dirty`; the commit is deferred to the
next `moe_submit` call, which flushes once via `resset_flush()` before it relies on the set
for residency.

This is correct — not just fast — because of an existing invariant the codebase already
depends on for `resolve()` to work at all: a slab's `coli_metal_register` call (mutex-guarded)
always completes and releases `g_slab_mtx` before any dispatch that references that slab's
pointer can call `resolve()` for it (the caller in `glm.c` cannot pass a freshly-loaded
expert's pointer to a dispatch before the load — which registers it — returns). Since
`resset_flush()` also takes `g_slab_mtx`, and runs immediately before `moe_submit`'s own
`resolve()` calls in program order, any slab a given `moe_submit` invocation will resolve was
already `addAllocation:`-ed (and marked dirty) strictly before that invocation's
`resset_flush()` runs — so the flush is guaranteed to cover it, regardless of what other
threads are concurrently registering unrelated slabs.

`resset_remove`, by contrast, commits synchronously and immediately, with no batching,
because the caller (`glm.c`, in every one of the four slab-realloc call sites, and in
`kv_alloc`) frees the underlying host memory *right after* `coli_metal_unregister` returns.
An uncommitted-but-still-set-member allocation pointing at memory the host has already freed
is a potential use-after-free the GPU could act on — deferring that removal is not a
performance-vs-safety tradeoff, it's just unsafe, so it isn't deferred. (The spec's own
lifecycle wording backs this reading: "`coli_metal_register` → add allocation + commit
**(batch commits where call pattern allows)**" carries a batching allowance that
"`coli_metal_unregister` → remove + commit" does not.)

## Instrumentation parity

No existing counter's semantics changed. `coli_metal_moe_times`/`coli_metal_moe_counts`
(`g_t_setup`, `g_t_gpu`, `g_t_kernel`, `g_t_scatter`, `g_moe_ok`/`g_moe_fb`/`g_moe_experts`)
are computed exactly as before — `resset_flush()` runs *before* `ts_start = mnow()` in
`moe_submit`, so its cost (whatever it is) is **outside** `g_t_setup` and therefore invisible
to the existing setup/gpu/kernel breakdown. This is a deliberate choice: it keeps the
orchestrator's A/B harness reading the same counters with the same meaning across stock/E4/E5,
but it also means the harness's existing numbers will not show E5's flush cost if it turns
out to be non-negligible — see UNCERTAINTIES. No new counters were added (no `glm.c`
`profile_print` changes), unlike E4's `METAL-HEAP: alloc fallbacks` line, because there was no
`glm.c` touch point to hang a print on without adding one — judged not worth the extra diff
surface for an experiment branch; `[METAL] residency-set: on` / the two fallback stderr lines
from `coli_metal_init` are the only new observability, sufficient to confirm which path a run
took.

## Per-seam differences vs E4

| Seam | E4 (`e4/metal-heap`) | E5 (this branch) |
|---|---|---|
| Allocation | New: `MTLHeap` sub-buffers via `coli_metal_heap_alloc` | Unchanged: same `posix_memalign` + `newBufferWithBytesNoCopy` |
| `glm.c` / `backend_metal.h` | Touched (new alloc/free API, 4 call sites + `expert_host_release`) | **Untouched** |
| Residency scope | Declared once **per command buffer** (`useHeap:`, still inside `moe_submit`) | Declared once **for the process** (queue-attached set), refreshed incrementally at register/unregister |
| Hazard tracking | Heap sub-buffers forced `MTLHazardTrackingModeUntracked` always (allocation-level) | Untouched at the resource level; `moe_submit` alone stops calling `useResource:` (encoder-level), independent of `COLI_METAL_UNTRACKED` |
| Per-buffer vs per-set skip | `[b heap]` (Metal's own `MTLResource.heap` property) checked per buffer — heterogeneous mixes possible if a slab fell back to malloc | Blanket `if (!g_resset_enabled)` — homogeneous by construction, since every registered slab goes through the same `coli_metal_register` path when the gate is on |
| Availability guard | None needed (`MTLHeap` is old API) | `@available(macOS 15.0, *)`, matching this box's macOS 26.5 but required for portability |
| Known regression | +12–13s expert-disk load at cap16 (suspected first-touch/lock contention on heap pages) | None expected — malloc pages never change ownership; **unverified without a run** |

## What to measure (orchestrator, cap1/cap16, stock vs E4 vs E5)

1. **GPU stall** (`coli_metal_moe_times` gpu/kernel breakdown) — success: E5 ≈ E4's
   −85%-class reduction vs stock at cap16.
2. **Expert-disk load path** (existing load/service-time counters) — success: E5 ≈ stock,
   i.e. **no** repeat of E4's +12–13s tax, since allocation is untouched.
3. **tok/s** — should track (1) and (2) together.
4. **md5 within a fixed dispatch composition** — flag on vs off must be byte-identical at a
   given cap (the "Output-invariant by construction" hard constraint); flag-on vs flag-on
   across cap1/cap16 may legitimately differ (different dispatch composition, per the
   fix-plan's "Determinism side-finding").
5. **`[METAL] residency-set: on` line present in stderr** at flag-on startup, and absent
   (or the OS<15/create-failed fallback line) otherwise — cheap sanity check that a run
   actually exercised the intended path before trusting its numbers.
6. If the hypothesis holds (E5 stall ≈ E4, E5 load-path ≈ stock, identical output), E5 becomes
   the upstream PR candidate and must include the cap-default recalibration flagged in PR
   #386's CURRENT-STATE CALIBRATION markers, per the spec's validation plan.

## Build

`cd c && make glm METAL=1` and a separate explicit `-Wall -Wextra` compile of
`backend_metal.mm` (the Makefile's `METALXX` line does not itself pass `-Wall -Wextra`, so
"clean under `-Wall -Wextra`" was checked with those flags added explicitly), plus
`cd c && make glm` (plain, non-Metal — unaffected, since this diff never touches `glm.c`), and
`make metal-test` (existing synthetic kernel-correctness unit test — no model, no
`glm52_i4/`, random weights — run once with `COLI_METAL_RESSET` unset and once with
`COLI_METAL_RESSET=1` to numerically exercise `coli_metal_register`/`moe_submit`'s changed
code path, since the task scope excludes running the real model). Exact results in the final
report, not here (build results belong to the report per the task's deliverable split, and
this file is written before the batched build run, per the scheduling constraint).

## UNCERTAINTIES

**Everything below is a judgment call, a seam where the residency-set lifecycle interacts
with the existing queue/command-buffer structure, or something unverifiable without a real
model run — flagged per the task's hard requirement.**

1. **The central design risk: skipping `useResource:` in `moe_submit` gives up Metal's
   automatic hazard tracking for that buffer set.** Apple's `MTLResidencySet.h` header
   (read directly from this box's SDK at
   `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/.../Headers/MTLResidencySet.h`)
   documents the protocol only in terms of residency; Apple's own "Simplifying GPU resource
   management with residency sets" guide states plainly: *"You don't need to call
   `useResource`/`useHeap`... for allocations in a residency set,"* and separately, the
   `MTLResidencySet` class reference states *"Residency sets don't support hazard tracking,
   so you need to account for hazards with fences and events."* I reasoned through every
   code path that touches `moe_submit`'s `use` buffers (read-only, indirectly referenced,
   never concurrently written, freed only after the engine's own slot lifecycle guarantees
   no outstanding async reference) and concluded removing `useResource:` there specifically
   is safe — but this reasoning is **not the same as having run the model**. If any code
   path I didn't trace lets a slab get unregistered while an async `moe_block_begin` handle
   is still in flight and reading it, this change removes a mitigation (weak as it may have
   been) that existed before. **This is the #1 thing to watch for md5 divergence on**, and
   the reason the scope was deliberately narrowed to `moe_submit` alone rather than applied
   uniformly.
2. **`resset_add`/`resset_remove`/`resset_flush` all run under `g_slab_mtx`, serializing
   concurrent OMP loader threads' residency-set mutations against each other and against
   dispatch's flush.** `MTLResidencySet`'s own header says *"all methods are non-threadsafe"*
   (confirmed directly from the SDK header), so this serialization is required for
   correctness, not optional — but it is structurally the same shape as the bug E4's
   audit-round-2 found and fixed (mutex held across a live Metal call, serializing loader
   threads during warmup fan-out, suspected root cause of E4's +12s regression). Apple's
   guide frames `addAllocation:`/`commit` as lightweight bookkeeping relative to the actual
   (deferred, async) page-in work ("Metal makes allocations resident when you call `commit()`
   on the first command buffer using the set" — implying `commit()` itself doesn't
   synchronously page anything in), which is why I judged holding the mutex across these
   calls acceptable unlike E4's `newBufferWithLength:` (a real allocation call). **This is
   unverified without profiling a loaded run** — if `commit()` or `addAllocation:` turns out
   to be synchronously expensive on this hardware/OS build, this could reproduce E4's
   expert-disk-load regression through a different code path, defeating E5's entire premise
   (decoupling residency from the load path). Orchestrator: this is the single most important
   number to check E5's load-path timing against stock, not just against E4.
3. **`resset_flush()`'s cost sits outside `g_t_setup`/the `moe_times` breakdown** (it runs
   before `ts_start = mnow()`), by design, to keep the harness's existing counters meaningful
   — but this also means if `commit()` is expensive, it will show up as *general* wall-clock
   slowdown / tok/s regression without a corresponding line in the existing instrumentation
   pointing at it. No new counter was added for it (see "Instrumentation parity" above) to
   avoid a `glm.c` touch; if E5 numbers look off without an obvious cause in the existing
   breakdown, `resset_flush`/`commit()` cost is the first place to add a throwaway probe.
4. **`initialCapacity = 4096` on the `MTLResidencySetDescriptor` is an unverified guess.**
   It's documented as a presize hint only (no correctness effect either way), chosen to be
   "clearly larger than the permanent-weight-tensor + KV-cache + plausible cap16 LRU-slab
   count" without actually counting those registrations precisely. Too small just means
   internal array growth; not a correctness concern, flagged only because it's a number I
   picked without measuring.
5. **Not calling `requestResidency()` proactively.** Apple's guide frames it as an optional
   latency-hiding call ("call ahead of time during non-critical moments... to minimize [first
   command buffer] latency"), and Blender's Cycles PR (the spec's cited reference
   implementation) doesn't appear to use it either per its PR description. Omitted to keep
   the lifecycle minimal and match the reference pattern; if profiling shows a
   first-command-buffer-after-a-load-burst latency spike, this is the documented lever to try
   next, not implemented here.
6. **The deferred-commit correctness argument (item in "Deferred-commit design" above) rests
   on a single-writer-before-single-reader program-order guarantee that is true today by
   inspection but is not an invariant enforced anywhere in code** (no assertion, no type-level
   guarantee) — it's the same kind of implicit ordering `resolve()` itself already depends on
   for correctness (a slab must be registered before any dispatch can resolve its pointer),
   so this diff doesn't introduce a new category of fragility, but it's worth naming
   explicitly rather than leaving implicit.
7. **Async `moe_block_begin`/`moe_block_end` overlap with concurrent `register()` calls**
   (background loader threads registering new/different experts while an unrelated MoE block
   is still in flight on the GPU) was reasoned through but never exercised in a real
   concurrent stress scenario — the synthetic `metal-test` unit test's `run_moe` calls are
   single-threaded and synchronous (`coli_metal_moe_block`, not the async `_begin`/`_end`
   pair), so it does **not** cover this interleaving. The real engine's `PILOT`/prefetch and
   `moe_block_begin`/`_end` overlap path is exactly the concurrency shape most likely to
   expose a bug in this design if one exists, and is untested here by construction (out of
   scope: no model runs).
8. **`coli_metal_gemm` (prefill path) and `bind_gemv` (attention path) still call
   `useResource:` unconditionally, so they get no CPU-overhead benefit from the residency set
   even though their buffers are also set members.** This is deliberate (see "Why only
   `moe_submit` skips" above) but means E5's win, if any, is scoped to the decode-path MoE
   dispatch loop specifically — prefill and attention timing should be unaffected by the flag,
   which is itself a testable prediction the orchestrator's harness can check.
9. **API surface verified against this box's actual SDK headers**
   (`MTLResidencySet.h`, `MTLDevice.h`, `MTLCommandQueue.h`, `MTLAllocation.h`,
   `MTLResource.h` — all read directly, not from memory) and against Apple's own
   "Simplifying GPU resource management with residency sets" guide, so the method names/
   signatures (`newResidencySetWithDescriptor:error:`, `addResidencySet:`,
   `removeResidencySet:`, `addAllocation:`, `removeAllocation:`, `commit`) are
   high-confidence. What is **not** independently verified is runtime behavior beyond what
   the docs state and what the synthetic unit test exercises — no substitute for the
   orchestrator's real cap-sweep battery.
